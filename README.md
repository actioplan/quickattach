# quickattach
A very simple plugin for the zim personal wiki ([https://zim-wiki.org/]) to add attachments from the command line. I use it in a cron job to add automatically jots taken on a tablet to my daily notes in zim.

To install this plugin to you zim installation, add the python file to ~/.local/share/zim/plugins. Restart your zim desktop, the plugin should be automatically added to your install. You don't need to activate it, thus activating it won't harm either.
